These two folders contain two projects of different classes from Rutgers University. The Final_Project folder contains the files for a website that demonstrates the use of AJAX, PHP, MySql, and REST APIs to create a website that allows users to track his/her ingredients on hand and receieve recipes based on them. The Inventory_App folder contains files for the complete life-cycle of a product targeted at a specific audience, which is further explained in the READ_ME file in the folder.
