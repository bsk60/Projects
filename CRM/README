A simple prototype CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tool created using Java for MVC framework, Hibernate ORM tool for backend, 
and JSP/HTML5/CSS3/Javascript/Bootstrap for frontend. The backend functionality such as adding in roles, employees, and permissions works fine, but 
updating a role's permissions based on roleID still needs to be further worked on. The frontend is very basic as functionality for the 
prototype was the most important part and frontend will be further improved by incorporating AngularJS framework and migrate the application
into a SPA (Single Page Application).
