The Inventory Application was a project created in Management of Technological Organizations class with the intention of providing user
friendly and affordable inventory management to small sized restaurant owners. The website was created to act as a "professional" website
where it introduced our product along with the functionality and a working demo where the user can store the ingredient along with quantity
and location. The project included elements such as mockups, Gantt chart, and ROI to demonstrate the full process of developing an application.
